        <h1>Definition of Plant Diseases and Pests Detection Problem</h1>
        <p>Plant diseases and pests is one kind of natural disasters 
			that affect the normal growth of plants and even cause 
			plant death during the whole growth process of plants 
			from seed development to seedling and to seedling 
			growth. In machine vision tasks, plant diseases and pests 
			tend to be the concepts of human experience rather than 
			a purely mathematical definition.</p>
